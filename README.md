# scirep

This is a small program to convert a Markdown file containing
LaTeX-style math formulas and OCaml code to an HTML page. The OCaml
code gets evaluated and the output is printed. Graphical outputs can
also be integrated to the page. See `test.md` for an example.

`scirep` builds on the following awesome libraries: `omd`, `vg`,
`higlo` and `core`. It also borrows some code from `stog`.

Beware: this is very experimental code.
